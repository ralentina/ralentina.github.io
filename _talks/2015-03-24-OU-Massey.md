I was an invited speaker to the 7th Doreen Massey Annual Event: Digital Geographies ([see full programme](http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/preview.php?whichevent=2493&s=1)), where I discussed some of the challenges in using OpenStreetMap and other tools to map Jerusalem from a Palestinian perspective. You can find my [slides](https://www.grassrootsalquds.net/sites/default/files/20150506_Valentina_Carraro_DM7_OU_2015_copy_0.pdf) on the [Grassroots Jerusalem](https://www.grassrootsalquds.net) website.

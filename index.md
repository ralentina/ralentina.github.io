I'm an assistant professor at the [Department of Human Geography, Planning and International Development](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-social-and-behavioural-sciences/disciplines/human-geography-planning-and-international-development/human-geography-planning-and-international-development.html) of the University of Amsterdam. 
I work at the intersection of digital, political and urban geography.

Prior to this, I was a postdoc fellow at [CIGIDEN](http://www.cigiden.cl/) / Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica de Chile, in Santiago. Funded by [Fondecyt](https://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/), my project built on political ecology, intersectional theory and critical GIS to study the production of disaster vulnerability on the Chilean central coast. A second project, in collaboration with [Dr. Sarah Kelly](https://www.kellygeolab.com), Jos√© Miguel Valdes and [Mapuexpress](https://www.mapuexpress.org/), used crowdsourced mapping and media research to analyse how the pandemic affects the indigenous territories of Wallmapu.

My doctoral research was funded by the [Hong Kong Research Grants Council](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/) and examined the politics of web-maps in/of Jerusalem. My forthcoming book, based on this project, is titled '[Jerusalem Online: Critical Cartography for the Digital Age](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9789811633133)'.

Alongside my academic work, I collaborate on a project-basis with [Grassroots al-Quds](https://www.grassrootsalquds.net/), an activist collective that supports Palestinians in Jerusalem through research, mapping and community mobilisation.

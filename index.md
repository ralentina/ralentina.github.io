I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Human Geography, Planning and International Development](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-social-and-behavioural-sciences/disciplines/human-geography-planning-and-international-development/human-geography-planning-and-international-development.html) of the University of Amsterdam. I'm part of the Political and Economic Geographies programme group of the Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research (AISSR).


 Broadly, I work at the intersection of digital, political and urban geography. My research interests revolve around three main themes:
* the way digital technologies intervene on the built environment and socio-political relations
* mapping, as both an object of research and a method that can facilitate dialogues across disciplines and epistemologies
* the political ecology of 'slow' disasters and its relation to high-tech, data-driven approaches to sustainability and disaster risk reduction


My first book, '[Jerusalem Online: Critical Cartography for the Digital Age](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9789811633133)', has been published by Palgrave-MacMillan in 2021. It is based on my PhD research, which was funded by the [Hong Kong Research Grants Council](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/). This work examines the politics of web-maps in/of Jerusalem, drawing on ontological social theory and feminist technoscience. It considers three case studies, each related to a different map provider and a recent mapping development: Google Maps and the distributed authorship of web-maps; Waze and algorithmic navigation; OpenStreetMap and crowdsourcing. Overall, the research argues for the need to develop new theoretical and methodological approaches to critical cartography, while holding on to the discipline's critical sensibilities. The project was awarded a 'Best Thesis Award' by the [Hong Kong Political Science Association](https://hkpsa.wordpress.com/home/about-hkpsa/).


Between 2019-2021, I was a postdoc fellow at [CIGIDEN](http://www.cigiden.cl/) / Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica de Chile, in Santiago. Funded by [Fondecyt](https://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/), my project built on political ecology, intersectional theory and critical GIS to study the production of disaster vulnerability on the Chilean central coast. A second project, in collaboration with [Dr. Sarah Kelly](https://www.kellygeolab.com), Jos√© Miguel Valdes and [Mapuexpress](https://www.mapuexpress.org/), used crowdsourced mapping and media research to analyse how the pandemic affects the indigenous territories of Wallmapu.


I hold a PhD from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), a Masters in Urban Studies from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), and a Bachelor in Architecture from [Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin).


Alongside my academic work, I collaborate on a project-basis with [Grassroots al-Quds](https://www.grassrootsalquds.net/), an activist collective that supports Palestinians in Jerusalem through research, mapping and community mobilisation.

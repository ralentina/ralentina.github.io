I'm a postdoc researcher at [CIGIDEN](http://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/) an interdisciplinary disaster research centre based at Universidad Católica in Santiago de Chile. Here, I study how scientists conceptualise, measure and map social vulnerability to disasters, how their knowledge relates to / contrast with local knowledge, and how different ways of knowing can be integrated through innovative GIS methodologies.
My PhD - awarded in 2019 by [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) - examined the political implications of the geospatial web, focusing on the web-maps of Jerusalem as a case study. While previous studies had showed that geoweb technologies tend to replicate global patterns of uneven representation, my project revealed the specific interplay between online maps and local political processes of settler colonialism, thereby demonstrating the importance of ‘grounded’ approaches to digital research.
Broadly, my work contributes to the fields of urban studies, digital geographies, science and technolgy studies and critical cartography. You can read more about it [here](https://vcarraro.com//about), or by emailing me at: valentina.carraro[@]cigiden.cl

I'm an urban studies scholar based in Santiago de Chile, with a specific interest in critical cartography and mapping.

My research examines the politics of geographic knowledge, with a focus on (a) the transformations brought about by the latest generation of ICTs and (b) the impact of socio-environmental data on territorial planning and governance for disaster management. 

Funded by [Fondecyt](https://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/), my core project examines disaster vulnerability on the Chilean central coast, drawing on political ecology, intersectional theory and critical GIS. 

A second project, in collaboration with [Dr. Sarah Kelly](https://www.kellygeolab.com), Jos√© Miguel Valdes and [Mapuexpress](https://www.mapuexpress.org/), uses [crowdsourced mapping](https://www.mapuexpress.org/coronavirus/) to analyse how the pandemic affects the indigenous territories of Wallmapu.

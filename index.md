I'm a postdoc researcher based at the [Pontificia Universidad Católica](https://www.uc.cl/) in Santiago de Chile and affiliated with [CIGIDEN](http://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/). My core project, funded by a postdoctoral fellowship from [Fondecyt](https://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/), examines the interactions between environmental and socio-economic inequalities through an intersectional lens, using participatory mapping and mixed-method GIS. A second project, developed in collaboration with [Dr. Sarah Kelly](https://www.kellygeolab.com), José Miguel Valdes and [Mapuexpress](https://www.mapuexpress.org/), uses crowdsourced mapping to monitor and analyse [the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in Wallmapu](https://www.mapuexpress.org/coronavirus/).

My PhD, awarded in 2019 by [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) and funded by a doctoral fellowship from the [Hong Kong Research Grants Council](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html), examined the political implications of the geospatial web, focusing on the web-maps of Jerusalem as a case study. While previous studies had showed that geoweb technologies tend to replicate global patterns of uneven representation, my project revealed the specific interplay between online maps and settler colonialism, thereby demonstrating the importance ‘provincialising’ the field of digital geography through situated empirical research and comparative approaches.

Broadly, my work contributes to the fields of human geography, digital geographies and critical cartography. You can learn more about it [here](https://vcarraro.com//about), or you can email me at: valentina.carraro[@]cigiden.cl

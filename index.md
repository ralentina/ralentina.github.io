I'm an urban studies scholar based in Santiago de Chile, with a specific interest in critical cartography and mapping. My research examines the politics of geographic knowledge, with a focus on (a) the transformations brought about by digital technologies and (b) the impact of socio-environmental data on territorial planning and governance for disaster management. 

Funded by [Fondecyt](https://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/), my core project examines disaster vulnerability on the Chilean central coast, drawing on political ecology, intersectional theory and critical GIS.  A second project, in collaboration with [Dr. Sarah Kelly](https://www.kellygeolab.com), Jos√© Miguel Valdes and [Mapuexpress](https://www.mapuexpress.org/), uses crowdsourced mapping and media research to analyse how the pandemic affects the indigenous territories of Wallmapu.

My doctoral research was funded by the [Hong Kong Research Grants Council](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/) and examined the politics of web-maps in/of Jerusalem. My forthcoming book, based on this project, is titled 'Jerusalem Online: Critical Cartography for the Digital Age'; it will be published by Palgrave MacMillan in 2021.

Alongside my academic work, I collaborate on a project-basis with [Grassroots al-Quds](https://www.grassrootsalquds.net/), an activist collective that supports Palestinians in Jerusalem through research, mapping and community mobilisation.

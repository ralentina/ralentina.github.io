I'm a postdoc researcher based at the [Pontificia Universidad Católica](https://www.uc.cl/) in Santiago de Chile and affiliated with [CIGIDEN](http://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/). My core research, funded by a postdoctoral fellowship from [Fondecyt](https://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/), examines the interactions between environmental and socio-economic inequalities through an intersectional lens, using participatory mapping and mixed-method GIS.  

A second project, developed in collaboration with [Dr. Sarah Kelly](https://www.kellygeolab.com), José Miguel Valdes and [Mapuexpress](https://www.mapuexpress.org/), uses crowdsourced mapping to monitor and analyse [the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in Wallmapu](https://www.mapuexpress.org/coronavirus/).

Broadly, my work contributes to the fields of urban studies, digital geographies and critical cartography. You can learn more about it [here](https://vcarraro.com//about), or you can email me at: valentina.carraro[@]cigiden.cl

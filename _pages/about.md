Since March 2019, I am a postdoc researcher affiliated with [CIGIDEN](http://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/), an interdisciplinary disaster research centre based at [Pontificia Universidad Católica](https://www.uc.cl/) in Santiago de Chile.  I joined the *Social Practices* cluster and the Research Line #6 [Information, communication and technologies for disaster management](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/l6-communication-and-emerging-technologies-for-disaster-risk-reduction/). Starting from April 2020, I am funded by a postdoctoral fellowship from [Fondecyt](https://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/). My project, titled 'An intersectional GIS to measure disaster social vulnerability', examines the interactions between environmental and socio-economic inequalities through the lens of intersectional theory, using [participatory mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgTzUPkVNBQ&feature=youtu.be) and mixed-method GIS.  

In collaboration with Mapuche collective [Mapuexpress](https://www.mapuexpress.org/) and [Dr. Sarah Kelly](https://www.cigiden.cl/sarah-kelly/), I am also working on [a crowdsourced mapping project to monitor the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in Wallmapu](https://www.mapuexpress.org/coronavirus/), and to support bottom-up solidarity initiatives and practices of resistance to neoliberalism and extractivism. 

I have completed a Ph.D. at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), fully-funded by the [HKPFS Fellowship](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html) from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council. 
The project developed from my experience working as GIS assistant for a Palestinian NGO, [Grassroots Jerusalem](https://www.grassrootsalquds.net), when I became interested in how emerging geospatial technologies reproduce or challenge current patterns of socio-economic and political inequalities. My research developed into a broader attempt to ‘update’ critical cartography through insight from feminist technoscience studies. Through this framework, I examined features such as crowdsourcing, algorithmic navigation and the semantic web, considering their usage and effects in the context of Jerusalem. To this end I drew on digital methods as well as six months of fieldwork, during which I conducted interviews with users and local experts. While previous work had shown that online mapping platforms tend to replicate global patterns of uneven representation, my study revealed the specific interplay between web-maps and settler colonialism, thereby demonstrating the importance of ‘provincialising’ the field of digital geography through situated empirical research and comparative approaches. The project was awarded the [Hong Kong Political Science Association](https://hkpsa.wordpress.com/)'s Best Thesis Award and the Chow Yei Ching School of Graduate Studies' Outstanding Research Thesis Award. 

I hold a Masters in Urban Studies from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (awarded with distinction), and a Bachelor in Architecture from [Berlin Technische Universität](https://www.tu-berlin.de).

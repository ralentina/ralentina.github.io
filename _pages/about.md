As a postdoc fellow at [CIGIDEN](http://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/) (Centre for Integrated Disaster Risk Management), in Santiago, Chile, my research revolves around the use of mapping methodologies to facilitate participation and the incorporation of local knowledge into disaster management and research. I belong to the Social Practices cluster and the [Research Line #6 -Information, communication and technologies for disaster management](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/l6-communication-and-emerging-technologies-for-disaster-risk-reduction/).

I have completed a Ph.D. at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supported by the [HKPFS Fellowship](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html) from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council. My doctoral research investigated the political implications of digital information and mapping technologies, taking the web-maps of Jerusalem as a case study. The project examined recent developments such as crowdsourcing, algorithmic navigation and the semantic web, and popular map providers, notably Google Maps, Waze and OpenStreetMap. I argued that these transformations require us to develop new approaches to cartographic research, and explored the potential contribution of ontological theory to critical cartography. The project was awarded with an <i>Outstanding Research Thesis Award 2019</i> by the Chow Yei Ching School of Graduate Studies.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a GIS assistant for [Grassroots Jerusalem](https://www.grassrootsalquds.net), an NGO that seeks to amplify Palestinian perspectives through mapping and advocacy. I hold a Masters in Urban Studies from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (awarded with distinction), and a Bachelor in Architecture from [Berlin Technische Universit√§t](https://www.tu-berlin.de).

I am a postdoc researcher at [CIGIDEN](http://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/) (Centre for Integrated Disaster Risk Management), in Santiago, Chile, where I belong to the Social Practices cluster and the [Research Line #6 -Information, communication and technologies for disaster management](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/l6-communication-and-emerging-technologies-for-disaster-risk-reduction/).

My work revolves around the use of mapping of disaster-related risk and has two strands. On the one hand, I am part on an interdisciplary team piloting a participatory model of disaster risk management in the town of [Cartagena](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cartagena,+Valpara%C3%ADso/@-33.538427,-71.6334441,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x966243ffd2d49c21:0xf078adc7723cce70!8m2!3d-33.5482466!4d-71.6045745). My contribution focuses on the development of mapping methodologies to facilitate the involvement of local actors, for example [environmental activists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgTzUPkVNBQ&feature=youtu.be) and youth. The second strand of my research examines how scientists conceptualise, measure and map disaster risk, with a focus on its ‘social’ components, i.e. resilience and vulnerability.

I have completed a Ph.D. at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supported by the [HKPFS Fellowship](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html) from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council. My doctoral research investigated the political implications of digital information and mapping technologies, taking the web-maps of Jerusalem as a case study. The project examined recent developments such as crowdsourcing, algorithmic navigation and the semantic web, and popular map providers, notably Google Maps, Waze and OpenStreetMap. I argued that these transformations require us to develop new approaches to cartographic research, and explored the potential contribution of ontological theory to critical cartography. The project was awarded with an <i>Outstanding Research Thesis Award 2019</i> by the Chow Yei Ching School of Graduate Studies.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a GIS assistant for [Grassroots Jerusalem](https://www.grassrootsalquds.net), an NGO that seeks to amplify Palestinian perspectives through mapping and advocacy. I hold a Masters in Urban Studies from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (awarded with distinction), and a Bachelor in Architecture from [Berlin Technische Universität](https://www.tu-berlin.de).

Since March 2019 I'm a postdoc researcher at [CIGIDEN](http://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/), an interdisciplinary disaster research centre based at Universidad Católica in Santiago de Chile. I joined the *Social Practices* cluster and the Research Line #6 [Information, communication and technologies for disaster management](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/l6-communication-and-emerging-technologies-for-disaster-risk-reduction/). My work examines how scientists conceptualise, measure and map social vulnerability to disasters, how their knowledge relates to / contrast with local knowledge, and how different ways of knowing can be integrated through innovative GIS methodologies. The research is based in [Cartagena](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cartagena,+Valpara%C3%ADso/@-33.538427,-71.6334441,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x966243ffd2d49c21:0xf078adc7723cce70!8m2!3d-33.5482466!4d-71.6045745) and is part of a larger interdisciplinary project piloting a participatory model of disaster risk management.

I have completed a Ph.D. at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), fully-funded by the [HKPFS Fellowship](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html) from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council. My PhD investigated the political implications of the geospatial web, focusing on the web-maps of Jerusalem as a case study. It examined features such as crowdsourcing, algorithmic navigation and the semantic web, using ethnography observations, interviews, visual and media analysis. While previous work had showed that geoweb technologies tend to replicate global patterns of uneven representation, my work revealed the specific interplay between online maps and local political processes of settler colonialism, thereby demonstrating the importance of ‘grounded’ approaches to digital research. The project was awarded the [Hong Kong Political Science Association](https://hkpsa.wordpress.com/)'s Best Thesis Award and the Chow Yei Ching School of Graduate Studies' Outstanding Research Thesis Award. 

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a GIS assistant for [Grassroots Jerusalem](https://www.grassrootsalquds.net), an organization that seeks to amplify Palestinian perspectives through mapping and advocacy. I hold a Masters in Urban Studies from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (awarded with distinction), and a Bachelor in Architecture from [Berlin Technische Universität](https://www.tu-berlin.de).
